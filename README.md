# Piratrrr
a slack bot which let's you talk in pirate accent w/o learning it!! :wink:

## Let's get started..
First clone this [repo](https://github.com/uniquepersun/piratrrr.git) **OR** just grab a latest zip from [releases](https://github.com/uniquepersun/piratrrr/releases/latest) <br> Now, as I have provided a `requirements.txt` file which contains all required PKGs & libs so you just hit 
```
pip install -r requirements. txt 
```
in your terminal and have fun :sunglasses:

## Secrets
you'll need some secrets, for which you need to ask slack [here](https://api.slack.com/apps) and that `bot token` you need put in a (dot)env file like [this](https://github.com/uniquepersun/piratrrr/blob/main/dotenv.txt)  

## wanna drop any suggestion or contribute :wrench:
